# Three main ideas:
# 1. Python is a program that launches another program.
#       We pass the code from main.py into the python virtual machine (PVM),
#           where it is executed. For example, >>> python main.py
# 2. Reading the output in the terminal after executing the program will help you
#       find the error. Everything is told in the terminal output,
#           the main thing is to look carefully.
# 3. Debugging is the first skill of a programmer.
#       It helps you to take a step-by-step look at how the program works.
